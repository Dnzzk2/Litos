This theme was developed during my free time, and the documentation may not be comprehensive enough, but I will try my best to explain it.

### Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed in your development environment:

- :link[Node.js]{id=https://nodejs.org/en/download} - Required for running the development environment.
- :link[pnpm]{id=https://pnpm.io/installation} - Our preferred package manager for dependency management.
- :link[Git]{id=https://git-scm.com/} - For version control and project management.
- :link[VS Code]{id=https://code.visualstudio.com/} - Recommended code editor with excellent development experience.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have other alternative tools, then you don't need to follow the recommendations in this article.

### Startup project

There are two ways to do this:

- :link[Fork the repository]{id=https://github.com/Dnzzk2/Litos/fork}
- :link[Use this template]{id=https://github.com/Dnzzk2/Litos/generate} - In the future, content-free branches will be launched, which do not require deleting and replacing content.

After you have your own repository, you can clone it to your local machine.

### Update Theme

When the theme releases a new version, you can pull the latest changes without losing your content by following these steps:

**1. Add upstream remote (only needed once)**

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Dnzzk2/Litos.git
```

**2. Fetch and merge the latest theme**

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main --no-edit
```

**3. Resolve conflicts (if any)**

Conflicts typically only occur in files you have modified, such as `src/config.ts`. In that case, just keep your own configuration and accept the rest of the theme updates.

> [!TIP]
> To minimize conflicts, try to only modify the following files:
>
> - `src/config.ts` — Site configuration
> - `src/content/` — Your posts and projects
> - `public/` — Your static assets (favicon, images, etc.)
> - `.env` — Environment variables
>
> Avoid modifying theme source files (components, styles, layouts) directly. This ensures smooth updates every time.

### End

The following documents will be divided into pages, such as readme, posts...
